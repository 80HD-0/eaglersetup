# eaglersetup
A program to set up an eaglercraft server instantly and easily.
## Prerequisites:
### For running without WSS
- Port 25565 open (SEE NOTICE!)
- A DEDICATED server computer (SEE NOTICE!)
### For running WSS
- Port 443 open (SEE NOTICE!)
- A domain (e.g. eagler.80hdnet.work or 80hdnet.work)
- Some knowledge of what you're doing (This can be dangerous!1!)
# NOTICE:
Eaglersetup REQUIRES port forwarding, no matter what! If you don't know what that is, you might not be cut out for it, but in simple terms it involves opening your device to the internet (NOT FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS! USE A DEDICATED SERVER!) and requires you to access your router's admin panel. If you don't know your router's admin password (NOT THE SAME THING AS A WIFI PASSWORD), ask your parents (or check the bottom of your router if you have Spectrum or something.) I mainly recommend finding a video on it. Remember: THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS. Opening your gaming PC or rando laptop to the internet that you use personally is NOT a good idea unless you plan to have the server up pretty often and know what you're doing. Try not to use your server for personal tasks.
